# UniversalAction
UniversalAction is a powerful and flexible action system for Roblox that allows developers to create, manage, and execute modular actions with minimal boilerplate. With this library, you can define custom actions once and invoke them anywhere—server or client—while maintaining strict validation, logging, and extensibility.
